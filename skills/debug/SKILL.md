# Debug - Test-First Bug Resolution

A systematic debugging approach that prioritizes test reproduction before attempting fixes, then uses specialized subagents to implement solutions proven by passing tests.

## Core Philosophy

> "Tests first, fixes second. A bug isn't fixed until the test passes."

Instead of jumping to solutions, this skill ensures:
1. **Reproducibility**: Create a failing test that captures the bug
2. **Isolation**: Understand the exact conditions that trigger the issue
3. **Proof**: Any fix must make the test pass
4. **Validation**: No regressions introduced by the fix

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:
- User reports a bug or unexpected behavior
- Something "doesn't work" but the root cause is unclear
- Complex issues that need systematic investigation
- Regression bugs in existing functionality

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Bug Report Analysis

**Step 1: Gather Bug Details**

Use AskUserQuestion to collect:
1. **What happened**: Expected vs actual behavior
2. **How to reproduce**: Exact steps, inputs, environment
3. **When it occurs**: Specific conditions, timing, frequency
4. **Impact**: Severity, affected users, business impact

**Step 2: Initial Investigation**

1. Locate relevant code using Grep/Glob
2. Read related files to understand current implementation
3. Identify potential root cause areas
4. Check existing tests for similar scenarios

### Phase 2: Test-First Reproduction

**Step 3: Create Reproducing Test**

```markdown
## Bug Reproduction Test

**File**: `path/to/test/file.test.js`
**Description**: Test that reproduces [bug description]

```javascript
describe('[Bug Name]', () => {
  it('should reproduce the reported bug', async () => {
    // Arrange: Set up the conditions that trigger the bug
    const input = [specific input that causes bug];
    
    // Act: Execute the problematic code
    const result = await problematicFunction(input);
    
    // Assert: This assertion should currently FAIL
    expect(result).toBe([expected correct behavior]);
  });
});
```
```

**Step 4: Verify Test Fails**

Run the new test to confirm:
```bash
npm test -- --testNamePattern="should reproduce the reported bug"
```

Expected: Test fails with the exact bug behavior reported

### Phase 3: Subagent Coordination

**Step 5: Launch Analysis Subagent**

```bash
Task:
Analyze the failing test and identify the root cause in the codebase.

Focus on:
- Why the test fails (trace execution path)
- Where the logic diverges from expected behavior
- What specific code change is needed
- Potential side effects of the fix

Return: Specific location and nature of the fix needed.
```

**Step 6: Launch Fix Subagent**

```bash
Task:
Implement the minimal fix needed to make the test pass.

Constraints:
- Only change what's necessary for the test to pass
- Don't introduce new abstractions or patterns
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Run tests after each change
- If tests fail, rollback and try a different approach

Return: The specific code changes made and confirmation the test passes.
```

**Step 7: Launch Validation Subagent**

```bash
Task:
Verify the fix doesn't break anything else.

Tasks:
- Run the full test suite
- Check for performance regressions
- Verify edge cases still work
- Look for related functionality that might be affected

Return: Confirmation that all tests pass and no regressions introduced.
```

### Phase 4: Final Verification

**Step 8: Complete Test Suite**

Run all tests to ensure no regressions:
```bash
npm test
```

**Step 9: Manual Verification (Optional)**

If the bug had a user interface component:
- Manually test the original reproduction steps
- Confirm the expected behavior now occurs
- Check related functionality wasn't affected

## Output Format

```markdown
## Bug Resolution Summary

### Bug Report
- **Issue**: [Brief description]
- **Reporter**: [User who reported it]
- **Impact**: [Severity/affected areas]

### Reproduction Test
- **Test File**: `path/to/test/file.test.js`
- **Test Name**: `[descriptive test name]`
- **Status**: ✅ Created and confirmed failing

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Location**: `file:line` 
- **Issue**: [What was wrong]
- **Analysis Subagent**: [Findings]

### Fix Implementation
- **Changes Made**: [Summary of code changes]
- **Fix Subagent**: [Implementation details]
- **Test Result**: ✅ Now passes

### Validation
- **Full Test Suite**: ✅ All tests pass
- **Regression Check**: ✅ No regressions found
- **Manual Test**: ✅ Original issue resolved

### Files Modified
- `src/...` - [What was changed]
- `tests/...` - [Added test coverage]
```

## Subagent Templates

### Analysis Subagent Prompt Template

```
You are a bug analysis specialist. 

A test is failing with this behavior:
[Insert failing test code and error]

Your task:
1. Analyze why this test fails
2. Trace the execution path that leads to the failure
3. Identify the exact location where behavior diverges from expected
4. Determine the minimal change needed

Focus ONLY on root cause analysis, not implementation.

Return format:
- Root Cause: [What's actually wrong]
- Location: file:line
- Fix Strategy: [How to fix it, but don't implement]
```

### Fix Implementation Subagent Prompt Template

```
You are a bug fix specialist.

Analysis indicates this issue:
[Insert analysis results]

Your task:
1. Implement the minimal fix at the identified location
2. Make the failing test pass
3. Follow existing code patterns exactly
4. Don't add complexity or new abstractions

Constraints:
- Only change what's absolutely necessary
- Run tests after each edit
- If tests fail, rollback immediately

Return format:
- Changes Made: [Specific code changes]
- Test Status: [Pass/Fail]
- Any Issues: [Problems encountered]
```

## Best Practices

### Test Writing Guidelines
- **Be specific**: Test exact conditions from bug report
- **Isolate variables**: Don't test multiple things at once
- **Clear assertions**: Expected vs actual should be obvious
- **Descriptive names**: Test name should explain the bug

### Fix Implementation Guidelines
- **Minimal changes**: Change only what's necessary
- **No overengineering**: Don't introduce patterns for one-off fixes
- **Consistent style**: Match existing code exactly
- **Immediate testing**: Run tests after each change

### Common Patterns

#### Logic Bug Fix
```javascript
// Before
if (condition) {
  doSomething();
} else {
  doSomethingElse(); // Bug: wrong logic here
}

// After
if (condition) {
  doSomething();
} else if (otherCondition) {
  doSomethingElse(); // Fixed: correct condition
}
```

#### Edge Case Bug Fix
```javascript
// Before
function processValue(value) {
  return value * 2; // Bug: doesn't handle null/undefined
}

// After  
function processValue(value) {
  if (value == null) return 0; // Fixed: handle edge case
  return value * 2;
}
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Test doesn't reproduce bug | Refine test with more specific conditions |
| Multiple possible causes | Narrow down with additional tests |
| Fix breaks other tests | Rollback and try different approach |
| Bug is in external dependency | Create workaround or update dependency |

## Notes

- Never skip the reproduction test phase
- Always verify the test fails before attempting fixes
- Use subagents for specialized tasks (analysis, implementation, validation)
- Keep fixes minimal and focused
- Document the complete resolution process for future reference
