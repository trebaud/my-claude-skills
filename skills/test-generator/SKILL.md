# Test Generator

Generate unit and integration tests for recently modified or added code by analyzing and following existing test patterns.

## When to Trigger

### Proactive (Automatic)
- **New files added without tests** - e.g., Added `src/service.ts` but no `src/service.test.ts`
- **Modified files with missing test coverage** - Functionality changed but no new tests added

**Never suggest tests for unchanged parts of the codebase.**

### Explicit User Request
- "generate tests"
- "write tests for this"
- "add test coverage"
- "test this file"

### Integration with Other Skills
- **create-pr**: After PR creation, check if changed files have tests
- **code-reviewer**: During review, identify missing test coverage

## Workflow

1. **Identify changed files** - Use git diff to find modified/added source files
2. **Check test coverage** - For each file, check if test file exists and if it covers changes
3. **Discover existing patterns** - Analyze existing tests to understand framework, structure, naming, mocking style
4. **Analyze code** - Identify exported functions/methods, what changed, dependencies
5. **Prioritize** - Focus on: public APIs, business logic, error handling, input validation
6. **Generate tests** - Happy path, error paths, edge cases (1-2 per function)
7. **Present to user** - Show what's missing before generating
8. **Write tests** - Follow existing patterns, update or create test files

## Test Generation Rules

For each function/method requiring tests:
- **Happy path** - Valid input → expected output
- **Error path** - Invalid input, thrown exceptions, error returns
- **Edge cases** - Boundary values, empty/null inputs (1-2 for critical functions)
- **Complex scenarios** - Multiple conditions, async behavior (only if complex)

Follow existing patterns for:
- Framework (Jest, Vitest, pytest, etc.)
- Test structure (describe blocks, before/after hooks)
- Assertion style (expect().toBe(), assert, etc.)
- Mocking approach (vi.mock(), jest.mock(), @patch, etc.)
- File location (co-located, separate directory, nested)
- Naming conventions

## Notes

- **Never overwrite** existing test files without user confirmation
- **Always follow** existing test patterns from the codebase
- **Focus on critical paths** - don't test trivial code
- **Use meaningful test names** that describe what and why
- **Keep tests simple** - one assertion per test when possible
- **Mock external dependencies** - tests should be isolated
- **Run tests after generation** to verify they work
- **Ask user** before overwriting existing test files
