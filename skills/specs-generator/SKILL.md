# Feature Specification Generator

Generate comprehensive SPECS.md files for features by gathering requirements through structured questioning.

## Instructions

When this skill is invoked, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Initial Context Gathering

Use the AskUserQuestion tool to understand the feature at a high level:

1. **Feature Name & Summary**: Ask for a brief description of the feature
2. **Problem Statement**: What problem does this feature solve?
3. **Target Users**: Who will use this feature?

### Step 2: Scope Definition

Use AskUserQuestion to clarify scope:

1. **Core Requirements**: What are the must-have functionalities?
2. **Out of Scope**: What should explicitly NOT be included?
3. **Dependencies**: What existing systems/features does this depend on?

### Step 3: Implementation Details

Gather technical details:

1. **Technical Approach**: Preferred implementation strategy
2. **Data Model Changes**: Any database/schema changes needed?
3. **API Changes**: New endpoints or modifications to existing ones?
4. **Integration Points**: External services or internal systems to integrate with

### Step 4: Design Choices

Explore design decisions:

1. **Trade-offs**: Ask about any known trade-offs (performance vs simplicity, etc.)
2. **Alternatives Considered**: What other approaches were considered?
3. **Constraints**: Any technical or business constraints to consider?

### Step 5: Edge Cases & Error Handling

1. **Edge Cases**: What edge cases should be handled?
2. **Error Scenarios**: How should errors be handled?
3. **Rollback Strategy**: What happens if something goes wrong?

### Step 6: Testing & Validation

1. **Acceptance Criteria**: How do we know the feature is complete?
2. **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests, integration tests, manual testing?

### Step 7: Generate SPECS.md

After gathering all information, generate a SPECS.md file using the template below.

## SPECS.md Template

```markdown
# Feature: [Feature Name]

## Overview

### Summary
[Brief description of the feature]

### Problem Statement
[What problem does this feature solve?]

### Target Users
[Who will use this feature?]

## Scope

### In Scope
- [Core requirement 1]
- [Core requirement 2]
- ...

### Out of Scope
- [Explicitly excluded item 1]
- [Explicitly excluded item 2]
- ...

### Dependencies
- [Dependency 1]
- [Dependency 2]
- ...

## Technical Design

### Architecture Overview
[High-level description of the technical approach]

### Data Model Changes
[Database/schema changes, if any]

### API Changes
[New or modified endpoints]

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST   | /api/... | ... |

### Integration Points
[External services or internal systems]

## Design Decisions

### Trade-offs
[Known trade-offs and why they were made]

### Alternatives Considered
[Other approaches that were considered and why they were rejected]

### Constraints
[Technical or business constraints]

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Edge Cases
- [Edge case 1]: [How it's handled]
- [Edge case 2]: [How it's handled]

### Error Scenarios
- [Error 1]: [How it's handled]
- [Error 2]: [How it's handled]

### Rollback Strategy
[What happens if deployment fails or feature needs to be disabled]

## Testing Strategy

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
- ...

### Testing Approach
- **Unit Tests**: [What will be unit tested]
- **Integration Tests**: [What will be integration tested]
- **Manual Testing**: [What requires manual verification]

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: [Phase Name]
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

### Phase 2: [Phase Name]
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

## Open Questions
- [Any unresolved questions that need answers]

## References
- [Link to related docs, PRs, or discussions]
```

## Guidelines for Questioning

1. **Be Adaptive**: Skip questions that aren't relevant based on previous answers
2. **Suggest Options**: When asking about technical choices, provide common options as suggestions
3. **Iterate**: If answers are vague, ask follow-up questions for clarity
4. **Keep Context**: Reference previous answers to build a coherent spec
5. **Limit Questions**: Group related questions together (max 4 questions per AskUserQuestion call)
6. **Provide Defaults**: Suggest sensible defaults when the user might not have strong preferences

## Example Question Flow

First question batch:
- "What is the feature name and a brief summary?"
- "What problem does this feature solve for users?"

Second question batch:
- "What are the must-have requirements? (List the core functionality)"
- "What should be explicitly out of scope for this version?"

Continue based on the feature type and user responses...

## Output

After gathering all necessary information, write the SPECS.md file to the current working directory (or a location specified by the user). Confirm with the user before writing if there's an existing SPECS.md file.
